GIVEN a functional Express.js API

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

    how to createn new products when the code is "Product.create(req.body)"? I was thinking about not using req.body, but instead, do the following:
    "
    Product.create({
        product_name: req.body.product_name,
        price: req.body.price,
        stock: req.body.stock,
        tagIds: req.body.tagIds
    })
